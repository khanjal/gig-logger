  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: October 31, 2025</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our application.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What We Log and Why</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>API endpoint name, duration, and success/failure</strong> (for performance and reliability)<br>
        <em>Sample:</em> <code>🎯 API Call: sheets-trips took 120ms, success: true</code>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Error types and endpoints</strong> (for debugging, no stack traces or request bodies)<br>
        <em>Sample:</em> <code>Failed to track error metric for ArgumentNullException</code>
      </li>
      <li><strong>User activity:</strong> only a hashed user ID and action (never raw IDs or PII)<br>
        <em>Sample:</em> <code>User activity: 1A2B3C4D performed AddTrip</code>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Rate limit events:</strong> only a hashed sheet ID<br>
        <em>Sample:</em> <code>Rate limit hit for sheet: 9F8E7D6C</code>
      </li>
      <li><strong>We do <u>not</u> log or store</strong> IP addresses, user agents, OAuth tokens, or Google Sheet contents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All logs are operational and non-identifiable. No trip, earnings, or sheet content is ever stored or analyzed. Data is relayed only for sync and never retained.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Rate Limiting and Temporary Caching</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To prevent abuse and ensure fair use, the app uses an in-memory rate limiter keyed only by a hashed version of your Google Sheet ID (never by user or token).</li>
      <li>This cache is never written to disk, is cleared after a few minutes of inactivity, and is not shared or logged.</li>
      <li>No personal data, trip content, or user identifiers are stored—only a technical hash of the sheet ID for rate limiting.</li>
      <li>The cache is used solely to enforce request limits and is never used for analytics or tracking.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Google OAuth Scopes</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><code>openid</code>: Associate you with your personal info on Google (for authentication only)</li>
       <li><code>drive.file</code>: See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the minimum required to let you log in and sync your gig data to your own Google Sheets. No other Google data or access is requested.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Authentication Tokens</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What tokens:</strong> We use Google OAuth tokens (access tokens, ID tokens, and a refresh token) to authenticate you and access your Google Drive/Sheets on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Where stored:</strong> All tokens are stored in your browser only. Access tokens are in secure cookies. Refresh tokens are stored encrypted in browser cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags. Your user ID is stored in browser localStorage for operational purposes only. No tokens are ever stored on our servers.</li>
      <li><strong>How used:</strong> Tokens are used solely to access your Google Sheets for syncing your gig data. They are never logged, shared, or used for any other purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>How long:</strong> Access tokens expire after 1 hour and are automatically refreshed. The refresh token persists for up to 1 year or until you explicitly log out or revoke access in your Google account settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the gig tracking service</li>
      <li>To sync your data with your Google Sheets (never stored on our servers)</li>
      <li>To monitor and improve reliability and performance (using only non-identifiable logs)</li>
      <li>To provide customer support and address technical issues</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Gig Worker Data Protection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your trip and earnings data stays private</strong> it is stored on your device and synced only to your Google Sheets</li>
      <li><strong>We never store or analyze your earnings or trip data</strong></li>
      <li><strong>No location tracking</strong> we help you search for places but don't store where you go</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Storage, Security, and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your trip and earnings data is stored only in your Google Sheets and on your device (browser IndexedDB)</li>
      <li>We use AWS CloudWatch for operational logs (see above), retained for 30 days</li>
      <li>No third-party analytics or error tracking providers are used</li>
      <li>All logs are non-identifiable and never include your data content</li>
    </ul>
