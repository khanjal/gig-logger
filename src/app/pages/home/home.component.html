    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Do I need to create an account?</h2>
            <p>You only need an account for Google sheets. No account is needed for this website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is it free?</h2>
            <p>Yes. There is no reason to monetize this very useful site.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How often should I save?</h2>
            <p>Feel free to save whenever you'd like. You can save after each trip, shift, or simply at the end of the day. Alternatively, you can enable auto-save, which will automatically save your progress every 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why does it take a while to save?</h2>
            <p>The save also runs multiple calculations and may slow down the saving process, as it waits for the calculations to complete.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is my data safe?</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored in your browser and Google Sheets. Gig Logger does not store any of your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I sync accross multiple computers?</h2>
            <p>You can access your sheet data across multiple browsers, but local data is only available in the browser where it was saved. It's strongly recommended not to save to the same spreadsheet from multiple browsers simultaneously, as this may result in data being overwritten.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do I delete my data?</h2>
            <p>On the setup page you can click delete all data to remove your local and remote data. Your spreadsheet data will remain untouched.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Array result was not expanded because it would overwrite data...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if data has been manually entered in the column below Row 1. The simplest way to resolve this is to delete all content in the column, leaving only the header.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Unresolved sheet name...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if a sheet it references has been deleted. Even if the referenced sheet is recreated, the link will remain broken. To fix this, you can refresh the header by clicking on it and pressing Enter to update it. Alternatively, if the sheet is protected with a lock symbol, you can delete it to regenerate the reference. However, be cautious, as this may break other sheets that depend on it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why does the trip/shift key have different formats?</h2>
            <p>Dates entered into the spreadsheet will be represented as a 5-digit number, while dates entered through the website will be stored as a string in the standard date format. Both formats are valid and can serve as part of the key, providing additional context regarding the source of data entry.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I change the date format?</h2>
            <p>Dates entered through the website are formatted for easy sorting and readability. Although you can adjust the format in the spreadsheet, the date will always be imported from the website in the yyyy-mm-dd format.</p>
