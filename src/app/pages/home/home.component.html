    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Do I need to create an account?</h2>
            <p>You only need an account for Google sheets. No account is needed for this website.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is it free?</h2>
            <p>Yes. There is no reason to monetize this very useful site.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How often should I save?</h2>
            <p>Save as often as you want! You can save after each trip, shift, or just once at the end of the day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do I edit saved data?</h2>
            <p>Once data is saved to the spreadsheet you'll need to go to Google sheets on your phone or computer to change data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why does it take a while to save?</h2>
            <p>A lot of calculations running will slow down the saving as it waits for the calculations to run.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is my data safe?</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored in your browser and Google sheets. Gig logger doesn't store any of your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I sync accross multiple computers?</h2>
            <p>You can view your sheet data on multiple browsers but your local data is only available in that browser.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do I delete my data?</h2>
            <p>On the setup page you can click delete all data to remove your local and remote data. Your spreadsheet data will remain untouched.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Array result was not expanded because it would overwrite data...</h2>
            <p>This error will occur in the header if you have manually entered data into the column below Row 1. The easiest way to fix this is to delete everything in the column except the header.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Unresolved sheet name...</h2>
            <p>This error will occur in the header if you deleted a sheet that it was referencing. Even if the sheet it references is recreated, it will still be broken. To fix this you can refresh the header by clicking in it and hitting enter to make it update. You can also delete the sheet if it's a proteced with the lock symbol and have it regenerate, but this could break other sheets if it's being referenced.</p>
