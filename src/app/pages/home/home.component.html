    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>How often should I save?</h2>
            <p>Feel free to save whenever you'd like. You can save after each trip, shift, or simply at the end of the day. Alternatively, you can enable auto-save, which will automatically save your progress every minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why does it take a while to manually save?</h2>
            <p>The save also runs multiple calculations and may slow down the saving process, as it waits for the calculations to complete.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is my data safe?</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored in your browser and Google Sheets. Raptor Gig does not store any of your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I sync accross multiple computers?</h2>
            <p>You can access your sheet data across multiple browsers, but local data is only available in the browser where it was saved. It's strongly recommended not to save to the same spreadsheet from multiple browsers simultaneously, as this may result in data being overwritten.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do I delete my data?</h2>
            <p>On the setup page you can click delete all data to remove your local and remote data. Your spreadsheet data will remain untouched.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Array result was not expanded because it would overwrite data...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if data has been manually entered in the column below Row 1. The simplest way to resolve this is to delete all content in the column, leaving only the header.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Unresolved sheet name...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if a sheet it references has been deleted. Even if the referenced sheet is recreated, the link will remain broken. To fix this, you can refresh the header by clicking on it and pressing Enter to update it. Alternatively, if the sheet is protected with a lock symbol, you can delete it to regenerate the reference. However, be cautious, as this may break other sheets that depend on it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>My data in the spreadsheet is either missing or has been overwritten. What should I do?</h2>
            <p>If you notice that data has been removed or overwritten, you can review the version history in Google Sheets by going to File > Version history. This will allow you to restore previous versions of the sheet. You may need to manually re-enter any changes. Once you've restored the missing data, don't forget to click Update from Spreadsheet on the website to sync the changes.</p>
