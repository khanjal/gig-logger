    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new Google spreadsheet</li>
        <li>Open <strong>File > Share > Share with others</strong></li>
        <li>Add <strong>srvsheets&#64;gig-sheets.iam.gserviceaccount.com</strong> as an <strong>editor</strong></li>
        <li>Go to setup page and add your spreadsheet id/link to the site</li>
        <li>Do not share your Google sheet ID with anyone!</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Normal Use</h1>
    <p>After setting up your Google Sheet and linking it to the app, you are ready to start logging your trips. Navigate to the Trips page to begin. If you haven't logged any trips today, the Shift/Group dropdown will display "New." Select or enter a service in the Service field, and optionally set a region to track trips in a specific area. This region will be reused for all trips in the same shift.</p>
    <p>When you accept an offer from your delivery app, start by filling out the Service and Region fields (if not already selected). Enter the pay and distance, then click "Store." For subsequent trips in the same shift, you can quickly add the pay and distance first. Complete the remaining details, such as Place, Type, Name, and pickup/destination addresses, when you arrive at the pickup or destination.</p>
    <p>After completing the delivery, click the "Dropoff" button to record the dropoff time. At this stage, ensure that most of the trip details are filled out. You can update the pay amount later to separate the base pay from the tip if needed.</p>

    <h1>Advanced Use</h1>
    <p>Each trip has a menu (represented by three dots) at the bottom, offering options to add a Next trip, Clone/Copy the trip, or Delete it. Adding a Next trip creates a new trip with the same pickup location and name. Cloning creates an exact copy of the trip, while deleting removes the trip if it hasn't been saved or flags it for deletion on the next save.</p>
    <p>The Place and Address fields allow you to search for input using Google Maps. This feature enables you to enter partial names or addresses and look them up later. For convenience, you can copy these fields directly from the Google Maps app or website.</p>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>How often should I save?</h2>
            <p>Feel free to save whenever you'd like. You can save after each trip, shift, or simply at the end of the day. Alternatively, you can enable auto-save, which will automatically save your progress every minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why does it take a while to manually save?</h2>
            <p>The save also runs multiple calculations and may slow down the saving process, as it waits for the calculations to complete.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Is my data safe?</h2>
            <p>Your data is stored in your browser and Google Sheets. Raptor Gig does not store any of your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Can I sync accross multiple computers?</h2>
            <p>You can access your sheet data across multiple browsers, but local data is only available in the browser where it was saved. It's strongly recommended not to save to the same spreadsheet from multiple browsers simultaneously, as this may result in data being overwritten.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How do I delete my data?</h2>
            <p>On the setup page you can click delete all data to remove your local and remote data. Your spreadsheet data will remain untouched.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Array result was not expanded because it would overwrite data...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if data has been manually entered in the column below Row 1. The simplest way to resolve this is to delete all content in the column, leaving only the header.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>#REF - Unresolved sheet name...</h2>
            <p>This error occurs in the header if a sheet it references has been deleted. Even if the referenced sheet is recreated, the link will remain broken. To fix this, you can refresh the header by clicking on it and pressing Enter to update it. Alternatively, if the sheet is protected with a lock symbol, you can delete it to regenerate the reference. However, be cautious, as this may break other sheets that depend on it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>My data in the spreadsheet is either missing or has been overwritten. What should I do?</h2>
            <p>If you notice that data has been removed or overwritten, you can review the version history in Google Sheets by going to File > Version history. This will allow you to restore previous versions of the sheet. You may need to manually re-enter any changes. Once you've restored the missing data, don't forget to click Update from Spreadsheet on the website to sync the changes.</p>
